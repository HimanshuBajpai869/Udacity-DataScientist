# Udacity-DataScientist Nano Degree Programme
This repository contains the projects completed as part of Data Scientist Nanodegree programme provided by Udacity!

The repository contains below folders :

1. Project - 1 : Under this project I have taken F.R.I.E.N.D.S dataset from kaggle and have done some EDA on it. The notebook and dataset
                 is available inside the folder.

2. Project - 2 : Under this project, below pipelines were created :

                  * ETL pipeline : 
                        - To prepare the data ready for modelling.
                        - Different Data cleaning process were applied like, removal of punctuations, converting to root forms etc.
                        - The cleaned data was pushed to the Database.
                        
                  * Machine Learning Pipeline :
                        - ML algorithm was applied on the dataset obtained from ETL pipeline.
                        - Best parameters of the algorithm were obtained by Grid Search CV.
                        - Model was exported using pickle library
                        
                  * Flask Based Web App :
                        - API to consume the model created using ML pipeline for end user to use.
                        
 3. Project - 3 : Recommender System created from IBM Community Dataset
 
 4. Project - 4 : Capstone Project on identifying Fake or Real tweets related to Disaster. The dataset is taken from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data
